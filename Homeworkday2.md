**MACHINE LEARNING**

* Machine learning is a segment of artificial intelligence that allows the computer to learn from data.
* It enables systems to improve performance on their own without explicit programming.
* It makes use of algorithms and statistical methods to find patterns and make predictions.
* It finds widespread use in speech recognition, recommendation systems, image classification, and healthcare among other tasks.
* Three major categories under Machine Learning include Supervised Learning, Unsupervised Learning, and Reinforcement Learning.
* By training on large datasets, machines are able to analyze data and make accurate decisions.
* Machine learning is finding an important place in automation, innovation, and solving complex real-world problems in different industries.
